1.0 -
Added additional iptables rules to protect against common DDoS attack methods, including SYN floods, UDP floods, and traffic with invalid TCP flags, invalid IP options, invalid TCP options, and packets with spoofed IPs from 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16 networks. Additionally, the fail2ban configuration file and filter file were updated to log session opened for user and to monitor /var/log/auth.log instead of /root, with an additional line added to the filter rules to detect when a session is opened for a user. Furthermore, my own traffic moniter was substituted for nload, as the former was producing incorrect traffic.
