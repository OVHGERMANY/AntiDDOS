# AntiDDOS
Welcome to my project! This project is an anti-DDoS script that aims to protect websites and servers from distributed denial of service attacks. It has been developed using Bash and iptables, and is intended for use by server administrators and website owners.

The script includes features such as a whitelist for trusted IP addresses, the ability to reset iptables rules, and the ability to add and remove IP addresses from the whitelist. It also includes a traffic monitor that displays incoming and outgoing traffic in real-time, and can alert the user if the traffic exceeds a specified threshold.

I hope you find this script useful in protecting your website or server from DDoS attacks. Please don't hesitate to leave feedback or suggestions. Thank you for checking out my project!
